## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/GhanshyamRamole/SmartMealBuddy.git
cd SmartMealBuddy
./setup.sh

# Configure environment
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database URL and API keys

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Start development servers
npm run dev  # Backend (port 5000)
cd ../frontend && npm start  # Frontend (port 3000)
```

### Docker Setup
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL connection string
